Here is my Computer Science learning journal. Hope that these notes could help people to help people who love math.

Note: most of the math notes are hand-written as a PDF, so they are in google drive (too big to upload them on Github). In the resource, some books are co-authored, but considering the space, I only wrote the first author. Also, because of the copyright issue, there's no links of the books.
