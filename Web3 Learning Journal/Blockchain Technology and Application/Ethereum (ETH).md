# Description
This is the second part -- Ethereum (ETH)

# Lecture 13: Ethereum Overview
Ethereum average block time -- 12 seconds

Mining puzzle -- memory hard (ASIC resistance)

Proof of Stake instead of Proof of Work

Support Smart Contract (If we can decentralize currency, what else can we decentralize?)

By the way, the minimum unit of BTC is Satoshi, and the minimum unit of ETH is Wei.

# Lecture 14: Ethereum Account
ETH utilizes account-based ledger instead of transaction based ledger in BTC. Thus, users can see how many ETH they have. To check the validity. we only need to compare saving with spending of that account, and we don't need to point out where the ETH is from.

In this way, double spending attack is impossible. 

Disadvantages: Replay Attack -- the payee broadcasts a transaction several times. (Note: it's impossible in BTC)

Solution:
