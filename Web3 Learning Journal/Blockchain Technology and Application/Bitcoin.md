# Introduction
Since there's no English version of this class online, and this is a really great class for beginners to understand 
some fundamental concepts and technology, I saved my English notes. 

Also, my notes are divided in two parts -- Bitcoin & Ethereum (ETH). This is the first part -- Bitcoin.
